<h1>Rob Whitaker</h1>

<p>My name is <strong>Rob Whitaker</strong>, and I am a developer, writer, and musician currently employed as a software engineer at IBM. Previously I worked as a front-end web developer at the start-up, Unlockable. I love working with functional languages.</p>

<p>I am always busy with a side project or seventeen at any given moment. These range from writing my interactive web serial novel to developing a custom reader application in Elm (or a CMS in PureScript) to composing a waltz for an animation on my keyboard. Sometimes I take a break from my usual side projects to join a hackathon or a game jam or a 24-hour short story competition. In November, I write like a maniac for NaNoWriMo.</p>

<p>I am also a fan of diners, pie, coffee, coffee and pie at diners, typewriters, playing the piano and guitar, reading, gaming, listening to music, and sometimes longboarding.</p>
